Let's implement an agent gateway by taking the reference from "https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/a2a". The idea is to create an agent gateway where people are able to add/edit/delete their agents and use in the application.
First let's install the libraries required for litellm gateway and a simple getway UI should be up and running with test agents as mentioned in the litellm documentation or no agents.
Once done, we will integrate the 3 agents(Finops, Tickets and Oxygen) and orchestrator agent(Jarvis) from the agentic_jarvis library (https://github.com/vishalkumar9dec/agentic_jarvis), As we have already done that, so it will be just replicating the behavior here in this project. Remember we have to follow take care of the libraries, versions and compatibility issues.

Feel free to ask any clarifying question and don't create unnecessary files.
